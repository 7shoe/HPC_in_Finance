# Week 4: 

# 1. Random Number Generation in C++ with Intel's `MKL` Library
## Single-Stream Random Number Generator
- Intel Math Kernel Library (`MKL`) allows parallel mode for random number generator.  
- lot's of features in available when including `mkl_vsl.h`
- [extensive documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-developer-reference-c/top/statistical-functions/random-number-generators/vs-rng-usage-modelintel-onemkl-rng-usage-model.html)
- example uniform
```
VSLStreamStatePtr stream;

int seed =777;
vslNewStream(&stream, VSL_BRNG_MT19937, seed);
```

- example Gaussian
```
float mean = 0;
float stdev = 1.0f;

float* rands = new float[1000];

// example with stream argument for parallel implementation
vsRngGaussian(VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_ICDF, stream1, 10, rands2, mean, stdev);

vslDeleteStream(&stream1);
```
- `VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_ICDF` [documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-vsnotes/top/testing-of-distribution-random-number-generators/continuous-distribution-random-number-generators/gaussian-vsl-rng-method-gaussian-icdf.html) is the random number generator of normal (Gaussian) distribution
- similarily `VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_BOXMULLER` [documentation](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/onemkl-vsnotes/top/testing-of-distribution-random-number-generators/continuous-distribution-random-number-generators/gaussian-vsl-rng-method-gaussian-boxmuller.html) for 1 random number or `VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_BOXMULLER2` [documentation](https://www.google.com/search?q=VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_BOXMULLER2&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS967DE970&oq=VSL_RNG_METHOD_GAUSSIAN_BOXMULLER2&aqs=chrome..69i57.651j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) for 2 random numbers

- `BOXMULLER_1` and `_BOXMULLER_2` generate 1 and 2 random numbers, respectively
- delete the stream afterwards

## Parallel RNG
- use *block splitting* or *leap frogging*
- **block splitting** 
    - 1st stream generates:     $x_{1}$, $x_{k+1}$, $x_{2k+1}$ 
    - 2nd stream ...      :     $x_{2}$, $x_{k+2}$, $x_{2k+2}$ 
    - 3rd stream ...      :     $x_{3}$, $x_{k+3}$, $x_{2k+3}$ 
- **leap frogging** (aKa skip-ahead method)

- Note: leap frogging is not supported by all `VSL BRNG`

## Example: Simulation of $\pi$ via parallel random number generation
```

```

# 2. Python 
`cProfile`
`N` body problems and `Julia Set`
`High P

## Login
On Midway, login and request a compute node (e.g. for 1 hour) going forward
`sinteractive --time=1:0:0`
will forward us to `siebenschuh@midway3-0007 {Dictionary}` or something
Then run
```
module avail python
module load python/anaconda-2021.05

ipython
```
which opens a promt in which code can be run cell by cell.

### `cProfiler`
cProfile provides deterministic profiling of Python programs. Each profile is a set of statistics that describes how often and for how long various parts of the program executed. The Python standard library provides two different implementations. Namely, `cProfiler` and `profile`. We care for the former. 

`cProfile` is recommended for most users; itâ€™s a C extension with reasonable overhead that makes it suitable for profiling long-running programs. Based 
[documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html)

Profile via 
```
python -m cProfile -s cumulative sample_file.py
```
only provides `ncalls` (number of function calls), `tottime` (total time spend) but it does not provide a line-by-line profiling.
On Midway, pip can be used to install libraries but they need to be installed into a local directory
```
cd .local/bin
pip install line_profiles
```

### `line_profiler`
Requires annotating the function we want to profile with annotator `@profile` 

## Python: A Dynamically Typed Language
C++ is static. At compile time a declared variable `float x = 1.0f;` is fixed as such. In Python, however, a variable `x` can be a float first `x = 1.0` and a `str` latter via `x = "Hello"`.

In Python, this dynamic functionality is realized with objects. These objects carry support operations. This results in additional overhead that is not useful when datatype discipline is applied.


## Cython
Allows usage of static C-type extensions for Python. The project's [website]()
Compiler is used to generate efficient C Code from Cython code which can be used in regular Python programs.

Imports
```
from setuptools import Extension,
from Cython.Build import cythonize
```

Example
```
cdef int a = 1
```
All C types are supported `bint` (instead of `bool`), `int, float`. Additionally, arrays and pointers are available.
```
cdef int k[10]
cdef double complex z, c
cdef unsigned int d
```
C functions and Python functions can call each other. *Fibbonaci* is a good example.
In the implemented example, `TreePricer_Numpy.py` which purely runs on a vectorized NumPy array. `TreePricer_Cython.pyx`, on the other hand, runs the same code in Cython. After profiling the entire function to be in C, it is imported in the main of `TreePricer_Numpy.py`. Both can be run to price `100` options. It takes `9.06 s` for the NumPy array and `8.94 s` for Cython. In contrast, only vectorizing the forward propagation of stocks takex `17x` longer.

To run the code:
```
ython TreePricer_Numpy.py build_ext --inplace
```
The `--inplace` option creates the shared object file (with .so suffix) in the current directory.

## GIL: Global Interpreter Lock
`OpenMP` and `Cython` can be used together! However, only Cython types and no egular Python object can be run within any loop. 

```
from cython.parallel import prange
import numpy as np

with nogil:
    for i in prange(length_zs, schedule="static"):
        z = zs[i]
        ...

```

Then run `python setup.py`

## Example: `N'-Body Problem
The 2nd typical example for CPU-bound problems
